Wazzup my fellow life forms!
For this to work best, please follow these steps:
1. In OBS Studio, right click on whatever window capture NintendoSpy/RetroSpy is set to and click filters. 
2. Click the + and select Chroma Key.
3. Click on the drop down menu and select Custom
4. Click Select Color and do one of the following
	a: Where it says HTML, type #c4ff0e, then click OK
	b: if you already have NintendoSpy/RetroSpy open, click Pick Screen Color and select the background for the skin, then click OK
5. Set Similarity to 29, set Smoothness to 279, and Key Color Spill Reduction to 202
6. Turn on your GameCube/Wii/Gamecube-USB adaptor and have some fun
NOTE: The Chroma Key is not perfect, however please change it if you feel you can make it better!

Thanks
Komali
